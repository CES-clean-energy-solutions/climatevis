# Engineering Weather Dashboard Context

## Use Case
- This project builds dashboards for **engineering analysis of EPW (EnergyPlus Weather) files**.
- EPW files include hourly data for dry bulb temperature, humidity, wind, radiation, and more.

## Typical Libraries
- `ladybug.epw`: parsing and loading EPW files.
- `psychrolib`: converting humidity ratio, temperature, pressure.
- `plotly`: used via wrappers in `lib/plots/` to produce heatmaps, histograms, exceedance charts.

## Dashboard Features
- Allow selecting columns like dry bulb temperature, wind speed, or radiation for analysis.
- Support multiple weather file comparisons with cumulative probability and percentile tools.
- Output plots into a final report, optionally downloadable as a PDF.

## AI Hints
- Favor visual, statistical summaries over raw data dumps.
- Use domain conventions: 5% exceedance, percentile bands, psychrometric plots.
- Any logic, plots, or UIs should support **environmental design**, **thermal comfort**, and **wind/solar modeling** workflows.
